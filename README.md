# Zenith Zenn Shopify Theme Customization

This project involves customizing the Shopify Dawn theme for the Zenith Zenn brand.

## Work Completed

1.  **Theme Enhancements (`layout/theme.liquid`)**:
    *   Improved SEO with structured data (Organization schema).
    *   Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for better social media sharing.
    *   Optimized performance with resource preconnects and prioritized loading.
    *   Added a scroll-to-top button for improved user experience.
    *   Included placeholders for custom CSS, JavaScript, and head content injection.
    *   Prevented image dragging.

2.  **Custom SleepWell Gummies Product Page**:
    *   Created a dedicated product template: `templates/product.sleepwell-gummies.json`.
    *   Developed a custom product section: `sections/main-product-sleepwell.liquid`.
    *   Added specific CSS styling: `assets/product-sleepwell-gummies.css`.
    *   Created a snippet to load styles and add JS functionality: `snippets/product-sleepwell-gummies-styles.liquid`.
    *   The page replicates the design and features observed on the live Zenith Zenn website, including the purple theme, bundle options, benefits, and trust badges.

3.  **Version Control**:
    *   Initialized a local Git repository in the `dawn-theme` directory.
    *   Committed all changes with the message "Add SleepWell Gummies product page".

4.  **Deployment Preparation**:
    *   Created a zip archive of the theme: `zenith-zenn-theme.zip` located on the Desktop (`/Users/d1f/Desktop`).

## Current Status & Deployment Challenge

The theme customizations are complete and committed locally. However, attempts to deploy the theme directly using the Shopify CLI or Theme Kit failed because these tools were not found in the current environment's standard paths or npm installations.

## Next Steps & Information Needed to Continue

To deploy the customized theme to the live Shopify store, the following information and actions are required in the next session:

1.  **Shopify Store Confirmation**:
    *   What is the Shopify store's URL (e.g., `your-store-name.myshopify.com`)?

2.  **Deployment Method**:
    *   How should the theme be deployed?
        *   **Shopify CLI**: Requires installation and authentication.
        *   **Theme Kit**: Requires installation and configuration.
        *   **GitHub Integration**: Requires setting up a GitHub repository and connecting it to Shopify.
        *   **Manual Upload**: Use the `zenith-zenn-theme.zip` file created on the Desktop.

3.  **If using CLI/Kit**:
    *   **Installation**: Confirm if the preferred tool (Shopify CLI or Theme Kit) can be installed.
    *   **Authentication**: Log in to the target Shopify store using the chosen tool (e.g., `shopify login --store your-store-name.myshopify.com`).

4.  **Deployment Execution**:
    *   Run the appropriate deployment command (e.g., `shopify theme push`, `theme deploy`) or upload the `zenith-zenn-theme.zip` file via the Shopify Admin interface.

Once these steps are completed, the customized theme, including the new SleepWell Gummies product page, will be available on the Shopify store.

## Prompt for Continuing Work in a New Session

Copy and paste the following prompt into a new session to continue the work:

```
I need your help continuing work on a Shopify theme customization project for Zenith Zenn. The project involves enhancing the Dawn theme and creating custom product pages.

So far, we've:
1. Created a custom SleepWell Gummies product page with purple theme styling, bundle options, and trust badges
2. Enhanced the theme.liquid file with SEO improvements and performance optimizations
3. Prepared a zip file of the theme for deployment

The code is in the dawn-theme directory on the Desktop. The main files are:
- templates/product.sleepwell-gummies.json (product template)
- sections/main-product-sleepwell.liquid (custom product section)
- assets/product-sleepwell-gummies.css (custom styling)
- snippets/product-sleepwell-gummies-styles.liquid (JS functionality)

Now, I need your help with the following tasks:

1. VISIT AND ANALYZE THE ZENITH ZENN WEBSITE:
   - Visit https://zenithzenn.com and take screenshots of all key pages
   - Analyze the product pages, homepage, collection pages, and checkout flow
   - Document the brand's color scheme, typography, UI components, and animations
   - Identify unique features that should be replicated in our theme

2. EXPAND THEME CUSTOMIZATION:
   - Create custom templates for the homepage, collection pages, and other product pages
   - Implement the same navigation, footer, and header structure as the live site
   - Add any custom sections observed on the live site (testimonials, featured products, etc.)
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness matches the live site

3. DEPLOY THE THEME:
   - Install Shopify CLI or Theme Kit if not already available
   - Authenticate with the Shopify store: [STORE_URL]
   - Deploy the theme using the appropriate method
   - Test all pages and functionality after deployment

4. ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Implement any custom JavaScript functionality observed on the live site
   - Add analytics tracking if present on the original site
   - Optimize page load speed with lazy loading and code splitting
   - Ensure all SEO elements are properly configured

Please start by exploring the existing files to understand the current state of the project, then proceed with visiting the Zenith Zenn website to gather more information for the remaining customizations.
